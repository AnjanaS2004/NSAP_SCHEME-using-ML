# Predicting NSAP Scheme Eligibility Using Machine Learning

A capstone project aimed at automating and enhancing the efficiency of beneficiary classification under the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP) using Machine Learning.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Manually processing applications for NSAP welfare schemes (for the elderly, widows, and persons with disabilities) is often slow and error-prone. This project builds a predictive model using demographic and socio-economic data to automatically classify applicants into appropriate schemes.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The manual approach to verifying and assigning NSAP schemes can:
- Delay assistance to deserving individuals.
- Introduce human errors.
- Overburden administrative staff.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

1. **Input Features**: Age, gender, income, marital status, disability status, household type, etc.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Null value handling
   - Categorical encoding
   - Normalization
3. **Training**:
   - Labeled demographic data
   - Model tuned for multi-class classification
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy (~99%)
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
5. **Deployment**:
   - Exported with `joblib`
   - Hosted using Flask or Streamlit
   - Role-based access and privacy protocols ensured
